          I can actually use the X-Team code challenge itself as a recent example of my debugging techniques! As quickly as I can,
          I identify the distinct components of the application (however large or small) that work together to provide the
          functionality that should be working, but is in a bad state (an exception is thrown). In the case of the X-Team
          code challenge, there's an intentionally written bug that I must identify and eradicate. So I intentionally break
          each part of the code that contributes to the functionality in question, so I can build it back up piece by piece.
          Now, I'm invested in the process, and feel like I'm writing the code from scratch! This makes the broken code much
          easier to find, because I'm going through the logic flow control step by step, and flipping the bits from broken
          state to working state. I'll know exactly where the last block of working code is! Using this technique, I fixed
          the bug in 10 minutes. I've provided a video walkthrough of this method of rapid debugging.
