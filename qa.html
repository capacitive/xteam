                the quality of the code? If possible, show an example from a recent project (pseudocode or link to a gist/commit/file)
                of how you rewrote some code to make it more testable.

            <p>Describe something that is considered a "best practice" for a technology you're familiar with, and what factors
                go into your decision of whether to follow it or not. Then, walk us through a code sample from a recent project
                where you've had to make such a decision. Your code sample can be links to commits/gists/files, or just paste
                snippets here and walk us through your decisions.

            <p>Above all during this process, we want to respect your time. That's our #1 goal. We only want to ask you for
                the amount of time we need to determine if you're a good fit for X-Team. For that reason, we ask this upfront:</p>

            <p>What is your desired hourly rate in USD?</p>

                Keep in mind we only offer contractor roles that are longer term (on average: 10 months) and full-time (40 hours per week)
