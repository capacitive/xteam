        Hi Amjad, Haya, Mason, Faris, Tim:

        Hi.
        
        My name is Mark Cafazzo.  My closest friends call me Sparky.
        
        I'm on a search - a journey, to find the right company to be an integral part of.  A team of people that love what they do, are a source of inspiration and are keen on challenging and helping me grow.  I've had some tough times working for certain companies that care not for my personal growth or that I'm working on something I care about. Technologically viable?  Who cares?  They just want the money for hours their engineers put in.  But I am strong, and really want to be part of a caring team passionate about their craft.  But enough about my troubles,  I have a story to tell...
        -----------------
        Chapter n=?
        -----------------
        My story went into its latest chapter after I took on a part time role as a boot camp instructor at University of Toronto's Continuing Studies department.  Not having officially taught programming before (although I've always enjoyed helping others learn to code), I was not prepared for the daunting task of instructing 24 novices in the arcane art of programming!  I began studying teaching techniques and teaching resources furiously, in an effort to aid in explaining these new and strange concepts to my class!  Lecturing wasn't working, and my feedback scores were dismal.  I looked for a way to bring the class together while I explained difficult concepts like JavaScript functions (hey, if you're new to it, it's confusing) in a much more simplified and visual way.  I needed a platform to immediately convey what the computer does with our code.  I tried CodePad, and Cloud9, but the former was too light, and the latter was too heavy.  Then one day I was reminded of REPL while checking up on what Brendan Eich was up to these days, and then I googled it, and then I found you guys and gal!  So I have begun creating a classroom to put my new-found teaching techniques in to action backed by a reliable environment that reacts to my student's input immediately, with almost zero configuration.  I also thought about using repl.it from the perspective of my own work and how it fills a certain need (or two, or n).  Then I began to wonder if there was more than enough work to be done at repl.it...  What if I could combine my latest teaching project with a programming job?  What if repl.it could have someone on their team who not only is a seasoned programmer/enthusiast, but who is also in love with the platform and using it in a real world classroom?  So I looked in your web site's footer for the ubiquitous Careers/Jobs link....
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Back quite a few pages to Chapter 2...
        ----------------------------------------------------
        My love for programming languages began in 1985, when my dad bought a ZX-81, and sent e off to a BASIC college course when I was 12.  I then fell back to tinkering, and dismantling my dad's IBM computers in an effort to discover how they worked.  I got away from tech for a while, then got back into it after college.  I started a self-made career, with humble beginnings in data entry and custom computer building, onward to the robot control system I developed for Toyota Manufacturing.  I've remained current in my technology and stack, using Nodejs, React, Redux and JavaScript, Java, C, C++, C# and .NET (not as much) and others interchangeably based on best fit for projects.  I consider myself a Deep Stack Polyglot Software Engineer with polymath tendencies. I work extremely hard on learning new concepts and creating the most stable applications I can muster.  I am fearless when I say I'll make it work.  And, as I currently teach U of T's Full Stack Coding boot camp, now I'm able to explain the difficult in a simplified way while the code is run in an effortless way!
        
        So, as I've been journeying along, on the lookout for a small, tight-knit family to do my best work with, I saw something in repl.it that I really like, and decided to tell you my story. You're now on to the latest page. 
        
        The rest is up to you.
