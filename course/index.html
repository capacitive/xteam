    "Hrrmmm... humm...", muttered the wizard, as he leafed erratically through a gigantic, dusty old leather bound tome that
    looked like it had an axe dent in the middle of its back cover, the pages like the sound of dry leaves scraping across
    cobblestone. His beard, spindled with his long dull white locks, and mottled with grey and silver, brushed and settled
    on the bottom half of the pages as they were sporadically turned. "Ah, yes, here it is! Recipe for rubenstia! It looks
    as if...". And his words trailed off as he realised where he was. Again. At the front of your class at The Helm, School
    of Programming Wizardry, a class that has grown quite accustomed to these sorts of divergences from the Lesson Plan (if
    such a thing existed). As if to punctuate the student's boredom and lack of clear direction during these moments, there

    and seem to have an enormous amount of wisdom when speaking on the topic of the Arcane Arts. Any other time, however,
    their understanding of how your mind works and how you feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of things you know nothing
    about seems to be as mysterious to them as the incantations they recite from memory that make the air almost spark into
    flame with electric energy.</p>

  <p> Are you struggling for motivation to stay in our program? Feeling lost under a huge pile of new terms and concepts? Never
    fear! You've taken on an enormous task, and sometimes it's even difficult for our seasoned Wizards to know how to best
    explain something so that the entire class (including you) can understand it. The Helm has a wide range of resources
    on campus to help you. One of them is a supplementary class called </p>
